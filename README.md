# lord-of-the-pigs

_Lord of the Pigs_ is a 2D top-down pixel-art game loosely based on the setting and story of Golding's _Lord of the Flies_. The game blends survival and colony management mechanics, mixing aspects from games like Rimworld, Dawrf Fortress, and many more...

As a result of a catastrophic crash, a group of schoolboys are stranded on an uninhabited and unknown island as the only survivors of the wreckage. Help is not promised, as all communication with the outside world has been lost. Whether coming or not, help will not arrive soon, and so the boys need to come together, and they might survive long enough to see rescue.

You must take control and commmand of an unlikely group of children, hopefully leading them all to survival. But you are no God, and these boys are mere schoolboys - you know nothing about them. A good first step in any plan is accessing your situation and bringing the team closer, not just to you, but to eachother, and it may be the crucial difference between a tragedy and a return trip.
